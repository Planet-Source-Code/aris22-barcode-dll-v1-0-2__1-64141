### Description

Fixed version of Barcode_DLL
 
### More Info
 
First i would like to thanks all those people who gives comment to my previous release of barcode dll. actually that was unfinished and for demo only to our client and later discontinued and become very busy with our government projects. actually there is a bug in the previous version of Code 128C coz it only checks for first consecutive Alphabet only and assume that the remaining are numeric. what other code 128 coderz dont do is combine the numeric to make the barcode much shorter. i also fixed some display issues plus included a 2D barcode PDF417. Im not the coder of PDF417, i just found it from the net and include it in my dll(http://grandzebu.net/informatique/codbar-en/codbar.htm). I didn't actually test this revision for i dont have barcode scanner as this moment to pls give me feedback if all barcodes are working or not. Dont forget to Install PDF417 font in windows\font directory.
